sentence=PCA9536 Driver (4-Channel GPIO I2C Expander)
paragraph=The PCA9536 is a 4-Channel GPIO Expander with a hardware I2C interface. The device's 4 channels (i.e. I/O pins) may be controlled all at the same time or individually in terms of their: [1] Mode (INPUT / OUTPUT), [2] State (for output pin mode only: HIGH / LOW), and [3] Polarity (for input pin mode only: NON-INVERTED INPUT / INVERTED INPUT). The State (LOW / HIGH) of pins in input mode may be read, whereas thoat of pins in output mode may be either read or written to. This library contains a complete driver for the PCA9536 exposing all the above functionality, as well as allowing uses to toggle the state of pins in input mode, and the option to recieve verbose information re the device's current settings and/or I2C communication results.
